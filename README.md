# README
Simple terminal snake game using ncurses.
Note that 2-player mode does not work. It just runs 1-player mode.

## Installation
Make sure you have ncurses libraries installed. Then just run
```
make
```
Note that the makefile looks for the ncurses libraries in /usr/include, so if your libraries are stored someplace else, change this!
